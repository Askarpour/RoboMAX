Before entering the room, the robot must check if the patient is available for vital signs checking, and if there is enough battery 
to perform all the tasks inside the room. Hospital rooms may have one or more beds. So the robot has to identify the correct patient either by asking or by scanning the patients barcode.  If the patient is not available, the robot should come back in 5 minutes. If there is not 
enough battery, the robot should recharge and the tasks need to be reassigned. Once inside the room, the robot should 
approach the patient, announce the procedure to be performed, and provide instructions to the patient. The failure of collecting 
any necessary vital signs should trigger a set of questions to assess the patient status for those signs that were failed to be 
collected. In case of non-response, an alert should be sent to the responsible nurse/doctor. Once the patient is checked, 
the robot should mark it as done and proceed to the next room. Patients subject to infectious diseases must be checked 
for heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and blood oxygenation. Patients subject to post-surgical conditions must be checked for heart 
rate and blood oxygenation. Patients with a history of diabetes must be checked for glucose levels in the blood. When a robot 
comes out of a room where a patient subject to infectious disease is being treated, it must be sterilized. All the patients in high 
risk must be checked in the first 15 minutes of the mission. If the robot is performing any duties with patient contact (touching the patient) it should disinfect its actuators afterwards.  Additional robots can be assigned to help in case of impossibility of 
performing the mission in the required time. The responsible manager for the site must be alerted if no combination of robots

23/12/2020 18:47:09,Author: Tim. J von Oertzen,Klinikum Linz Hospital - Johannes Kepler University, Seizure recognition and ictal testing,"The robot is located in the patients room. It will observe the patient and start interacting, if the patient seems to be non responsive or presents repetitive movements. Further triggers for interaction are provided by sensors and seizures detection software from EEG. 
When triggered, a robot should check attention and responsiveness of a patient. The robot must start the task within 30-60 seconds. In case of not being able to do so, a nurse should be immediately alerted. In order to be able to perform this task on very short notice, the robot should be within the patient room or very close by. At the time, the task is assigned, the robot should check if all the necessary equipment to collect the required tasks are available in the room, if not, the robot should go to the storage room and collect the equipment (sensors). Battery recharge routines must
not be triggered during operating the task. If the robot achieves less than 10% of battery, it should save checkpoints for every atomic action, log it, and alert the manager of the site. The goal is to improve diagnostic value of seizure reporting by recognising seizures and ictal testing.
For diagnostic purposes patient with epilepsy may undergo long term (24/7) video EEG monitoring for several days in hospital. Aim is to record seizures simultaneously on EEG and video. For the reporting of such seizure recordings it is important to know, if the patient is aware and responding, or if any of these capabilities is impaired. Therefore, applying a standardized test sequence of verbal commands and showing pictures to the patient as well as recording and interpreting the responses is crucial. A significant increase of heart rate is present in approx. 80% of focal epileptic seizures. At the same time, EEG changes occur and the patient's behaviour changes (e.g behavioural freezing, repetitive stereotyped movements, or non responsiveness). The robot will follow and observe the patient and will assess data provided by the Video-EEG analysis/seizure detection software or sensors (e.g., movement pattern detection and/or heart rate). If a heart rate increase occurs, the seizure detection software alerts, or the patients behavior changes, the robot will start to interact with the patient. Initially, it will ask if the patient is well or experiences a seizure. If there is no response or the patient confirms a seizure, the robot will start to apply the test sequence to the patient and alert the nurses to attend. The task is completed when a stop signal is received or a certain amount of time (specified beforehand) has passed.

In the collection phase, the robot must go to the storage places where the resources can be found. The order to be followed is defined by the 
estimation of waiting time summed up with the path to be run by the robot. Once the robot reaches one storage and it is time to request the 
resource, the robot sends a message to the storage with the precise specification of the requested resources and waits until the resources 
have been retrieved. Once retrieved, the delivery phase begins. In this phase, the robot will make as many runs as necessary to take all the 
resources to the specified location. If the battery of the assigned robot runs low (10\%) in the collection phase, the robot goes back to the 
recharging station and assigns the mission to another robot. If the battery of the assigned robot runs low (30\%) in the delivery phase, 
the robot must return the resource to a checkpoint and assign the remaining task to another robot, which will know where the resource is positioned. 
In case of failure to return the resource to a checkpoint, an alert must be triggered and the report sent to the sector manager. When multiple 
items are required from different storages, multiple robots can be assigned to parallel collect-deliver tasks to reduce the time to finish the

In this case, we will focus on the hospital scenario. To avoid the spreading of viruses and bacteria, hospitals use robots to disinfect rooms from viruses and bacteria after patients leave them. Operators in this scenario are typically hospital staff (e.g., nurses) who do not possess programming or robotic expertise. The operators use a graphical interface (normally in a tablet device) to communicate with the robot and assess the state of the mission. The scenario was inferred from a set of interviews conducted with industrial practitioners from Blue Ocean Robotics (http://blue-ocean-robotics.com).

A UVD Robot (UVDR) waits by default in its charging dock until an operator requests its help. These robots are designed to disinfect rooms by making use of UV lamps, for which they need to navigate across the hospital to the room requested by the operator. This step may be performed autonomously (i.e., the operator specifies the location to which the robot must autonomously navigate among a list of predefined locations) or the operator may manually drive (i.e., teleoperate) the robot.

Once the robot is located at the entrance of the target location (if the robot has autonomously navigated there, it will wait by the entrance) a series of prompts will appear in the operator’s graphical interface (e.g., ""I've arrived at the entrance of room A, please open the door”). The operator then needs to open the door to the room after which the robot will autonomously navigate inside.

Once inside the target room, the graphical interface will show the operator how the room should look like. This picture is taken during the so-called installation process, that is, an initial process where technical operators from the company perform tasks such as mapping the environment, setting regions of interest, and coding events that may happen during the scenario execution. The operator then makes sure that the room to be disinfected looks like the picture, e.g., making sure there are no strange objects on the robot’s way. 

Once the user confirms that the room is as expected, a set of questions prompt at the operator’s graphical interface. These questions are meant to ensure safety, for instance, asking the operator to make sure that no one will be in the room while disinfecting. After confirming these questions and pressing a confirmation button on the interface, the operator is requested to leave the room and close the door (the robot will wait idly in the meanwhile). The company installs frames at the locations set during the installation process that are meant to support the tablets while the robot disinfects the room.

The operator then may click on a “Begin” button on the tablet’s screen, after which the robot starts disinfecting the room and the tablet will show a warning sign ""Do not enter, robot disinfecting."" The tablet on the door is also a safety mechanism: it will sense if the door is opened and will immediately stop the robot’s operation.

If the disinfection ends without problems, the tablet screen will prompt a confirmation message ""Disinfection succeeded,"" after which the tablet can be safely removed and the door opened. The robot will autonomously leave the room and wait by the door. The operator then may decide what to do next: a) send the robot back to the dock station, b) teleoperate it to another room or c) send the robot to autonomously navigate to another room.",Medical,Single-robot,"Parameter adaptability (whether the robots can adapt their behaviour by changing some parameters, e.g., their speed)","Robot capabilities (e.g., perception and interpretive, robot task abilities, actions and envisioning capabilities),

The robots are also able to disinfect pre-defined spots by exposing them to the UV light of the lamps they have equipped. These robots communicate the status of their mission and receive updates from the operator by means of a graphical user interface.

These robots retrieve their missions described using behavior trees (concretely py_trees https://py-trees.readthedocs.io/en/devel/) and the query the configuration set during the installation process from a database. 

The robots also receive information from operators during runtime to carry on with their missions or to update parameters that may affect their missions.","-Duration: Operators may define the time a robot must spend disinfecting a room
-Safety: Robots do not start disinfection until the room is empty and will automatically stop it if the door to the corridors is opened. Robots are able to navigate through corridors and doors performing obstacle avoidance and will trigger a safety mechanism brake if avoidance is not feasible.
-Reliability: missions are specified with behaviour trees, which allows developers to define fallback behaviours to enable robots to cope with errors and prevented events.
-Versatility: Even though UVD robots are only intended to provide a service, the associated tasks are complex and require the robots to self-adapt depending on the context and current task.","UVD Robots tune parameters of their configuration at run time. For instance, the speed is changed while navigating through human-populated areas (e.g., the corridors of a hospital). Interviewed practitioners refer to this as ""contextual navigation,"" where different contexts are associated with specific sets of parameters.

An example that was regarded as especially complicated by the interviewees was going through doors. The robots need to adjust their speed to avoid collisions and as a safety measure in case a human decides to cross the door at the same time. The company provides a safety stop mechanism to avoid accidents, but they strive to avoid reaching this situation since this stop mechanisms is ""quite noisy and doesn't sound very friendly.""

Some parameters can also be tweaked by the operator during run-time. For instance, the operator can set the time a robot must spend disinfecting a room. This would entail for the robot to change its speed parameters.",Every mobile robot is subject to drift from its locomotion actuators. ,,,,https://www.uvd-robots.com,"The robots' software is overridden by a safety layer that will be triggered to prevent accidents (e.g., if a human jumps in front of the robot, the navigation and collision avoidance components are overridden to make the robot suddenly stop).
