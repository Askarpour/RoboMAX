# RoboMAX
Robotic Mission Adaptation eXemplars


This repository is an extensible collection of robotic mission adaptation exemplars to capture key sources of uncertainty, adaptation concerns, and other distinguishing characteristics of such applications.

## Methodology

1. If you are a robotic application stakeholder (e.g., researchers, developers, op erators, and end-users) and would like to contribute to this repository please fill the questionnaire below:

             https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ylljnC4DaTZ4FDwylv3sQ29ihnQz49KYkTQElmEF7Sc/edit

1. a. If you have any problem accessing this online questionnaire, you could fill it in the form of a PDF that you'll find [here](https://github.com/Askarpour/RoboMAX/blob/main/Questionnaire.pdf) and send it to us via email adresses that are mentioned below.

2. Once we recieve your answers, we will review them and get back to you if we need any clarification. The review process is done by the maintainers of the repository.

3. Once the most recently inserted exemplars are solid, we add them to the [collection](https://github.com/Askarpour/RoboMAX/blob/main/Exemplars.csv) which is accessible from this repository.

4. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need help with anything:
